Description:
------------
This folder contains 4 different projects (add,sub,mult,div) and builds them using cmake

1. Build all projects
cd example1
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

This generates the build artifacts for all 4 projects

2. Build projects one at a time
cd example1
mkdir build
cmake ../
make <target> example.) make add

This generates the build artifacts for the specified project (add)

3. Clean
rm -rf the build directory
OR
make clean

This gets rid of the build artifacts for all 4 projects
