Description:
-------------
In this folder, we are using cmake on files that are in different directories.

In the 'src' folder, we have our source (.cpp) files.
In the 'inc' folder, we have our header (.h) files to be included.

In order to build our project with both .cpp and .h files, we have to modify our CMakeLists.txt file
In the add_executable macro, we must provide the .cpp files by including the directory they are in:
    src/add.cpp
    src/sub.cpp
    src/main.cpp

Next, we must add the macro target_include_directories and provide it with the target, scope keyword, and directory we are using
    math, PUBLIC, inc

 
Now create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build
cmake 3 ../
make

The executable 'math' should be present
./math to run the program
